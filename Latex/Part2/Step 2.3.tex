\subsection*{Step 2.3}

To determine the values of $a_i$ and $b_i$ for $i \in \{1,2,3,4\}$ that minimizes the squared area between $f$ and $\hat{f}$, a new PWA function of $f(u_d)-\hat{f}(u_d)$ has been created where the regions of $f(u_d)$ have been synced with the four functions of $\hat{f}(u_d)$. This created four separate minimization problems which have been minimized with a non-linear least squares fit. A Matlab script \ref{} has been created to perform this PWA approximation, which can be examined for further explanation.
